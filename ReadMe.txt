1. I generaized my code. So most of my codes in tic-tac-toe and Gomoku​ are the same, and saved in base file(game.cpp).
In such case, I don't have virtual/ pure virtual method pair for turn, print, done,draw, prompt and play.
2.The input x,y are reversed. First digit corresponding to y axis, and second to x axis.
